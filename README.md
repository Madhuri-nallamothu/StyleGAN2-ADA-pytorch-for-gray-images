# StyleGAN2-ADA-pytorch-for-gray-images
This is code for StlyeGAN2-ADA-pytorch for gray images.

Since the orgianl code (https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch) does not work in gray scale iamges, I modified the code for gray images (N_channel=1). 

you should check the [notebook file](https://github.com/gunahn/StyleGAN2-ADA-pytorch-for-black-and-white-images/blob/main/StlyeGAN2-ADA-pytorch%20for%20black%20and%20white%20images.ipynb) for the usuage. 


Also, for comparison, I also uploaded DCGAN code [notebook](https://github.com/gunahn/StyleGAN2-ADA-pytorch-for-gray-images/blob/main/Knee%20X-ray%20images%20synthesis%20by%20DCGAN.ipynb) for 512*512*1 shape images
